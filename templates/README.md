## About the templates

- Templates are tile version specific. 
- There is a folder for each supported tile version.

### Deployment Properties Templates

deployment_properties.yml is a sample configuration that is used to generate a BOSH manifest.

Once a deployment is done, the generated bosh manifest from the template is stored in `$MANIFEST`, which is set to `~/workspace/bosh-solace-manifest.yml` by default.
